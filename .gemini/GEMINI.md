# Project Guardrails
- When recommending bridges, do NOT suggest items with higher Zerotrac rating than the current problem unless a structuralâ€‘easier justification is provided.
- Cite which source you used (Zerotrac, CLIST) in the output text for transparency.
- Keep outputs deterministic and terse: use numbered steps, no emojis.
